**# Road-Accident-Dashboard-USA-Excel-Project:**

This project turns raw USA accident data into insights using Excel with Pivot Tables, Slicers, and charts. Key findings: 417K casualties, cars cause 80%, urban roads are riskier, night driving is deadlier, and single carriageways are most dangerous. A clear view for safer road strategies.
Road Accident Dashboard – USA (Excel Project)

This project is all about turning raw accident data from the USA into clear and meaningful insights using Excel. I used Pivot Tables, Slicers, and different chart types (doughnut, line, bar, and treemap) to design a dashboard that tells the full story behind the numbers.

**What I Built:**

Summary cards for fatal, serious, slight, and car-related casualties.

Trend line comparing this year’s vs last year’s accident patterns.

Doughnut charts to show urban vs rural accidents and day vs night conditions.

Bar chart for casualties by road type.

Treemap for road surface conditions.

**Insights Discovered:**

There were 417,883 total casualties in the dataset.

Cars alone caused nearly 80% of all accidents.

Urban areas reported much higher casualties than rural ones.

Driving in the dark is riskier, with almost 97K casualties, compared to 37K in daylight.

Single carriageways are by far the most dangerous road type.

**Conclusion:**

This dashboard shows how simple Excel tools can uncover powerful insights from data. By analyzing where, when, and how accidents happen, we can identify the key risk factors — cars, urban traffic, dark conditions, and single carriageways. These findings can help shape better road safety strategies and raise awareness about safer driving habits.
